# CS225-HW4
Using the Scoreboard and GameEntry classes from the lecture (these will be
posted to Moodle), create a Scoreboard that can contain up to 20
GameEntry objects.
2. Now, create 20 new GameEntry objects with a name (Player 1, Player 2,
etc.) and a random score between 0 and 1000, and add them to your
Scoreboard array using the add method. Hint: The easiest way to create
your GameEntries is to use a loop.
3. Create a method inside the Scoreboard class that prints all the elements
inside the array to the screen. Then create another method which displays a
summary of the array. This method must include: the number of elements
inside the scoreboard, the highest and lowest values, range of scores and
the average value of the scoreboard. Demonstrate that both methods work.
4. Use the remove method to remove a random element from the array and
once again, print the elements inside the array and the summary of the
values remaining in the array.
